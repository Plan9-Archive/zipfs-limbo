# status

the tools and library can read and write common zip files.  encryption
is not supported, as are zip64 and most other mostly irrelevant
extensions.


# intro

zipfs consists of three parts:

- a read-only zip file system, allowing you to mount a zip file
  using styx.
- tools to read/list/write zip files.
- tool to rewrite zip file with files in different order.
- a library to read & write zip files.

see the manual pages getzip(1), zipstream(1) and zipfs(4) for more
information.  the library is currently undocumented.


# install

make sure $ROOT is set.  now "mk install" to compile and install
the files.

when building from within inferno, insert SYSHOST=Inferno and ROOT=
in the mk invocations to override the values in the mkconfig.


# latest version

# licence & author

all files are in the public domain.  this code has been written by
mechiel lukkien, reachable at mechiel@ueber.net.


# todo

- determine inflate problem on input, where inflate wants one more
  byte than in input stream, and then returns it as leftover byte.
- compressed central directory (part of zip64?)

perhaps:

- zip64 extensions
- use attributes:
  0xd=unix -> uid,gid,times,links/device
  0x8 => undocumented charset encoding...
  0x7075 => info-zip utf-8 path
  0x6375 => info-zip utf-8 comment
