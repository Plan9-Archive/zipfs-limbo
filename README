# status

the tools and library can read and write common zip files.  encryption
is not supported, as are zip64 and most other mostly irrelevant
extensions.


# intro

zipfs consists of three parts:

- a read-only zip file system, allowing you to mount a zip file
  using styx.
- tools to read/list/write zip files.
- a library to read & write zip files.

see the manual page getzip(1) for documentation about the tools
getzip, lszip and putzip.  see the manual page zipfs(4) for
documentation about the zip file system.  for now, the library is
undocumented.  the implementation of the programs should be regarded
as library documentation for now.


# install

ensure you have a valid "mkconfig" (including/binding/symlinking
your inferno's mkconfig works), then type "mk install" to install
the module file and compile & install the zip library and tools.


# latest version

get it from http://www.ueber.net/code/r/zipfs


# licence & author

all files are in the public domain.  this code has been written by
mechiel lukkien, reachable at mechiel@ueber.net or mechiel@xs4all.nl.


# todo

- determine inflate problem on input, where inflate wants one more
  byte than in input stream, and then returns it as leftover byte.

perhaps:

- zip64 extensions
- use attributes:
  0xd=unix -> uid,gid,times,links/device
  0x8 => undocumented charset encoding...
  0x7075 => info-zip utf-8 path
  0x6375 => info-zip utf-8 comment
